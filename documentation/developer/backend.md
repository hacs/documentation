Use the [integration blueprint](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint) to get started - copy it and build out your integration using the blueprint as a base.

The blueprint repo contains instructions on how to run your integration locally with Home Assistant running in a Docker container with a [Dev Container](https://github.com/custom-components/integration_blueprint/blob/master/.devcontainer/README.md)
