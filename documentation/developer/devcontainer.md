[The easiest way to contribute is to spin up a devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It has all the tools you need included, and it does not interfere with your system.

**Requirements:**

- Docker
- VS Code
- Remote - Containers (VS Code extension)

**Open a cloned repository:**

1. Fork [the HACS repository](https://github.com/hacs) that you want to contribute to.
2. Clone the repository to your computer.
3. Open the repository using VS Code.

When you open this repository with VS code you are asked to "Reopen in Container". This will start the build of the container.

*If you don't see this notification, open the command pallet and select  `Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container`*
