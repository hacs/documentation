In order to work, HACS needs to retrieve information about repositories using Github's API.

:::info
Because of the [rate limits set by Github](https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting), HACS needs to be authenticated by a Personal Access Token, that you can generate using the following steps.
:::

## Step 1 - Open browser

_You are probably looking at this in a browser, so we can probably check this off._

## Step 2 - Go to your GitHub "Developer settings"

_And then "Personal access tokens."_
or click here: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)


## Step 3 - Start generation

Click the "Generate new token" button.

_If you are asked to login, do so._

## Step 4 - Choices

First give it a logical name so that you can recognize it.

Then click the "Generate token" button at the bottom.

You **do not** need to check _any_ of the boxes.

## Step 5 - Copy

Now you see the generated token, this will be the **only** time you see it, make sure that you copy it manually or by clicking the clipboard icon.

Follow the [instructions here](legacy.md) to add the token to the Home Assistant configuration
