## Installed elements

HACS will check for updates to installed elements:

- At startup.
- Every 30 minutes after HA startup.

## Everything else

HACS will check for updates to every element:

- At startup
- Every 800 minutes after HA startup.

## Manually trigger updates

You can also force a check by clicking the "RELOAD DATA" button under the "SETTINGS" tab _(This will force a reload of everything.)_

Under the "SETTINGS" tab there is also a reload icon to the left of every custom repository you have added, clicking that will reload info for it.

On each RepositoryView (the page with details about the element) there is a reload icon at the top-right corner, clicking that will reload it.
