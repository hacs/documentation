:::note

This require at least these versions:

- Home Assistant 2022.8.0
- HACS 1.26.0

And you need to have the [`my` integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/my/)
:::

You can use [my](https://my.home-assistant.io) to link directly to an integration inside HACS.
This works for both default and custom repositories.

1. Start by going to https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=hacs_repository
1. Fill inn the filelds on that page to generate your my link.
    1. "Category" is only needed for custom repositories
1. Copy the URL or snippets you want for your my link.


Example for hacs/integration:

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=hacs&repository=integration)
