During setup HACS will add a new sensor to your installation (`sensor.hacs`).
The state of `sensor.hacs` is the number of pending updates (for HACS).

The HACS sensor also has several attributes that can be used for display and/or automation.

[Have a look here for automation examples](basic/automation.md)
