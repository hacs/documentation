You install HACS by using the [HACS install script](https://github.com/hacs/install).

:::info
If you are not sure what type of Home Assistant you are using, then you should probably not install HACS (or any other custom integration), but if you really want to know, you can find it here:

1. In your Home Assistant UI go to the Configuration panel
1. Click on the "Info" block.
1. Under the System health card it will say "Installation Type  xxxx"

## Home Assistant OS

1. Go to the Supervisor panel

1. Start the SSH add-on
1. Connect to the SSH add-on
1. Run the HACS install script
