:::note
This require [experimental features](/docs/configuration/options#options) enabled.
:::

HACS provide [update entities](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/update/) for all tracked repositories.

## Install service

Like all other [update entities](/docs/entities/update), you can use the `update.install` service to handle updates.

The "Version" field supports the folowing:

- A GitHub tag (release)
- A public branch of the repository (this does **not** include forks)
- The full (not first 7) SHA of a commit

_In case there is a branch and tag that have identical names, the tag will be used._

:::warning

Setting the version in this service call is considered an advanced feature, and should **NOT** be used without instructions to use it from the author of the repository you are updating.

:::

If the repository does not support versions, or if the specified version is not compliant with HACS (or your Home Assistant version) it will fail with a message similar to this:
