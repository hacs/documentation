This is where you get an overview of your installed repositories.

This view is split into sections, one for each category you have installed a repository for, and at the top you will quickly see repositories that have a pending update (if any)

You will see a status icon that indicates the status of the repository.
The color of that icon is [customizable with themes](/docs/basic/theming), but the default is:

Color | Description
-- | --
Green | All good
Orange | Update pending
Red | Restart pending, or not loaded.

If you hover over the icon you will also see a short description.
