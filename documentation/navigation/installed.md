![nav_installed](/img/nav_installed.png)

This is where you get an overview of your installed repositories.

You will see a status icon that indicates the status of the repository.
The color of that icon is [cuztomizable with themes](/docs/basic/theming), but the default is:

color | description
-- | --
Green | All good
Orange | Update pending
Red | Restart pending, or not loaded.

If you hoover over the icon you will also see a short description.
