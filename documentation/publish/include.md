As a developer you can now add your repository to be included in as a default repository in the store.

Only the owner of the repository or a major contributor to it can submit a PR to have it included as a default.

When all of this is covered, you can add it to repository category files in https://github.com/hacs/default

:::caution
_NB!: The list is case sensitive._

When a PR for this is merged, it will show up in HACS after the first scheduled scan (every 800min).

## CI Checks

When submitting a repository for the default repository a suite of CI checks will be run to ensure that the repository follows the requirements.
All checks needs to pass for the repository to be included (unless something else are agreed on).

Most of the checks will not run until you have completed all the tasks in the PR template.
