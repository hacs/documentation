First you need to have the repository already downloaded and managed by HACS.

Once that is in place, find the card for the repository you want to enable beta releases for, and click the 3 dots in the bottom right corner of the card to bring up the repository menu.
![repository_menu](/img/repository_menu.png).

In that menu click on "Redownload" to bring up the Redownload dialog.

![checkmark_beta](/img/checkmark_beta.png)

Activate the checkbox to the left of "Show beta versions", once you activate that HACS will fetch new information in the background, once that is done you can now [select a beta version](/docs/faq/select_version) to download.


:::note

Not all repositories will have beta releases, it is up to the author of the repository to use that.
