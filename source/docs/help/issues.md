**[First lets start out by stating that _ALL_ issues should be reported here](https://github.com/hacs/integration/issues)**

# What should be in the issue?

When you create an issue in the repository for HACS, you start by selecting a template.

All templates have a defined structure and it is **expected** that you follow it.

_Issues that are missing required information can (will) be closed._

## Flag

This should **only** be used, when there is grounds for removing (blacklisting) a repository in HACS.

When you are flagging a repository you need to supply at least these:

- A good description for why.
- The name of the repository.
- Proof that you have tried to contact the owner of that repository (link to issue)

_If you are flagging it because you don't like it, have issues with it, or it's not working, you should report that to the repository and not here._

## Issues

You use this when you have issues with HACS.

[To enable debug logs for HACS (required when adding an issue) have a look here](/docs/use/troubleshooting/logs.md).

Logs are **more** then _just_ errors, with debug logging it gives the person investigating the issue a full picture of what happened.


**What an issue should contain depends on the type, but at least:**

- A GOOD description of the issue.
- Debug logs.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- If the issue is in the UI, add screenshots.
- [Diagnostics](/docs/use/troubleshooting/diagnostics.md)

You can see examples of good/bad issues further down on this page.

!!! warning
    _Issues that are missing required information can (will) be closed._


!!! tip
    oh... and almost forgot... `latest` is **NOT** a version.

# Last words

The more time/words/examples you put in your issue, the faster someone can see/understand what you mean.
