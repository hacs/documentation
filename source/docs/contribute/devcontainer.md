[The easiest way to contribute, is to spin up a devcontainer](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) with Visual Studio Code (VS Code). It has all the tools you need included, and it does not interfere with your system.

**Requirements:**

- [git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs)
- Remote - Containers (VS Code extension)

**Open a cloned repository:**

1. [Fork](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project) [the HACS repository](https://github.com/hacs) that you want to contribute to.
2. [Clone](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Getting-a-Git-Repository) the repository to your computer.
3. Open the repository using VS Code.

When you open this repository with VS code, you are asked to **Reopen in Container**. This starts the build of the container.

_If you don't see this notification, open the command pallet and select  **Remote-Containers: Open Folder in Container**._
