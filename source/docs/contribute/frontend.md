The repository for the frontend is hosted @ https://github.com/hacs/frontend

First spin up the [devcontainer](/docs/contribute/devcontainer.md)

When you have that running issue the following commands:

```bash
yarn start
```

You have now started a local webserver that hosts the frontend on `http://localhost:5000` which you can attach to a Home Assistant instance that is running HACS.
