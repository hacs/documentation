**Home Assistant My links** can be used to link directly to a repository inside HACS. This is used for example, to share a link on Discord or to bookmark it. My links work for both default and custom repositories.

## To create a My link using a hotkey

1. In Home Assistant, open the repository of interest and press the `m` key.
      - The My link page opens, with the information already filled in. 
2. Copy the URL or snippets you want for your My link.

## To create a My link manually

1. Go to https://my.home-assistant.io/create-link/?redirect=hacs_repository.
2. Fill in the fields on that page to generate your My link.
   - **Owner**: the author of the repository. In the example of spook, this is "frenck"
   - **Repository**: the name of the repositroy. For example: "spook"
   - **Category**. efers to the type of repository. For example: "integration". Only needed for custom repositories.
