## Data storage

All repository data is saved in Home Assistant to files under `.storage` (hidden by default).

## Creating a backup

All HACS data is part of the regular Home Assistant backup. Make sure to regularly backup Home Assistant and store the backup files somewhere safe outside your Home Assistant instance. So that you can restore from the backup if needed.

For instructions to create and configure backups, see the Home Assistant [backups](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#backups) documentation.

## Restoring from a backup

To restore your installation from a backup, follow the steps on [restoring a backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/common-tasks/general/#restoring-a-backup) in the Home Assistant documentation.
