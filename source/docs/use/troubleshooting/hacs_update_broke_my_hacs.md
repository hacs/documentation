title: HACS update broke my HACS
description: "How to recover from a HACS update"

## Symptom

You updated to a newer version of HACS, be it manually or because you had previously set up an update automation, and now HACS does not seems to work as expected anymore.

## Remedy

The only way to recover is by restoring your previous setup from your backup.

To restore your installation from a backup, follow the steps on [restoring a backup](https://www.home-assistant.io/integrations/backup/#restoring-a-backup) in the Home Assistant documentation.
