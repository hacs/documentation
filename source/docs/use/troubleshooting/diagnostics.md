The diagnostics file is a JSON file with information about your instance. This file is particularly helpful when you want to report a HACS issue via issue tracker on GitHub. The diagnostics file provides context and helps people understand your setup.

To get the diagnostics file for HACS, follow these steps:

1. In Home Assistant, go to <!-- hacs:my integrations **{{coreui('panel.config')}}** > **{{coreui('ui.panel.config.dashboard.devices.main')}}** -->.
2. Select the **HACS** integration.
3. Select the three-dots menu, then select **Download diagnostics**.

    - This will download a file with `.json` file ending to the computer you are doing this from (usually the downloads directory), this file can be dragged into GitHub issues.
