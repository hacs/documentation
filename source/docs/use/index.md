Hi there :wave:

This is the beginning of the user documentation for HACS.

Use the sidebar to navigate this section.

!!! note
    This section explains how to use HACS. It does not show how to develop for HACS or how to publish.

    - If you want to publish something that can be tracked by HACS, take a look at the [publisher documentation](/docs/publish/index.md)
    - If you want to develop/change something for HACS itself, take a look at the [developer documentation](/docs/contribute/index.md)
