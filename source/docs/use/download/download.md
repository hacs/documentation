This section shows how to download HACS to your Home Assistant and how to troubleshoot some common issues.

## To download HACS

How you download HACS depends on your Home Assistant installation type. In the instructions below, select the tab that matches your installation type (OS/Supervised, Container, or Core).

!!! warning
    If you don't know what type of Home Assistant installation you are running, you should not use HACS (or any other custom integration).

=== "OS/Supervised"

    For Home Assistant Operating System and Supervised, there is an add-on for downloading HACS. To add the custom add-on repository that allows you to get this add-on, follow these steps.

    1. To add the HACS add-on repository to your Home Assistant, select this [my link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=cb646a50_get&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons).
        - When prompted to confirm if you want to open the page in Home Assistant, check if the URL is correct. Then, select **Open link**.
        - In the **Missing add-on repository** dialog, select **Add**.
        - You have now added the repository that allows you to download HACS to Home Assistant.
    2. In the **Get HACS** add-on, select **Install**.
    3. **Start** the add-on.
    4. Navigate to the add-on logs and follow the instructions given there.
