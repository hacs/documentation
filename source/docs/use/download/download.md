Setting up HACS is done by using the [HACS download script](https://github.com/hacs/get).

## To download HACS

This section provides instructions for each installation type. Make sure to select the tab that matches your Home Assistant installation type (OS/Supervised, Container, or Core).

!!! warning
    If you don't know what type of Home Assistant installation you are running, you should not use HACS (or any other custom integration).

=== "OS/Supervised"

    For Home Assistant Operating System and Supervised, there is an add-on for downloading HACS. To add the custom add-on repository that allows you to get this add-on, follow these steps.

    1. To add the HACS add-on repository to your Home Assistant, select this [my link](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/supervisor_addon/?addon=cb646a50_get&repository_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fhacs%2Faddons).
        - Once you selected the link, you are asked to confirm if you want to open the page in Home Assistant. Check the URL to your Home Assistant and select **Open link**.
        - This brings up the **Missing add-on repository** dialog. To add the repository, select **Add**.
        - You have now added the repository to your Home Assistant that allows you to download HACS.
    2. In the **Get HACS** add-on, select **Install**.
    3. **Start** the add-on.
    4. Navigate to the add-on logs and follow instructions given there.

=== "Container"

    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Go inside the container with `docker exec -it <name of container running homeassistant> bash`.
    3. Run the HACS download script.

        ```bash
        wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -
        ```

    
=== "Core"

    1. Open a terminal.
    2. Change to the user that is running Home Assistant.
    3. Run the HACS download script.

        ```bash
        wget -O - https://get.hacs.xyz | bash -
        ```
