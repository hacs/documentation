Each entry you see on the HACS dashboard refers to a public [GitHub](https://github.com) repository, created by someone from the community. This section shows you how to download such a repository to Home Assistant by using HACS.

## Prerequisites

This section assumes you have completed the following:

- [Downloaded HACS](/docs/use/download/download.md)
- [Configured HACS](/docs/use/configuration/basic.md)

## Downloading a repository

1. In Home Assistant, open HACS and find the repository of interest.
2. Select the repository and view it's overview page.
    - The main section of this view renders the README file of the repository.
    - The **badges** on top provide some key information, such as author, [GitHub](https://github.com) stars, and number of open issues and pull requests.
    - This page should also contain the documentation on how to use it.
    - The content depends on the repository [type](/docs/use/type/index.md) and on the information the author provides.

3. To download the repository, in the bottom-right corner, select the **Download** button.
    - Don't see a download button? The button doesn't show if the repository has already been downloaded.
