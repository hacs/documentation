This page assumes that you have completed the following steps:

## Setting up the HACS integration

1. In Home Assistant, go to <!-- hacs:my integrations title="**{{coreui('panel.config')}}** > **{{coreui('ui.panel.config.dashboard.devices.main')}}**" -->.
2. Clear your browser cache.
    - Before HACS can show up in the list, you need to clear your browser cache or perform a hard-refresh.
    !!! tip
        You actually need to do this, don't skip it.

3. In the bottom right corner, select **+ {{coreui('ui.panel.config.integrations.add_integration')}}**.
4. Search for **HACS** and select it.
5. Acknowledge the statements and select **Submit**.
6. Authenticate the integration:
    - HACS uses a device OAuth flow for authentication against the GitHub API.
    - Copy the device code and select the link [https://github.com/login/device](https://github.com/login/device).

    - Sign in to GitHub.
        - If you are not signed in to GitHub in your browser, you need to sign up or sign in now to continue the setup.
        - If you are already signed in, you can skip this part.
