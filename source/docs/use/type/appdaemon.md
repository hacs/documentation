AppDaemon apps are apps for [AppDaemon](https://appdaemon.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

!!! abscract "Not enabled by default"
    By default, AppDaemon apps are **not** visible in HACS because they are used only by a small subset of users. To see them, you need to enable discovery in the configuration options.

1. In Home Assistant, open the HACS configuration options as described under [Configuration options](/docs/use/configuration/options.md).
