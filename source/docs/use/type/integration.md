Integrations in HACS (or custom_components as they are often referred to) are community-built integrations.

## Special notes about Integrations

!!! info
    When you download, update or remove an integration in HACS, you need to restart Home Assistant.


!!! tip
    You _may_ need to clear your browser cache before you see it in the "+" list.

    _Note that this **only** applies for the initial download of that Integration, if you update it, you still need to restart Home Assistant before it loads the new files._


## Integrations download location

Any Integration you download with HACS is stored in your [Home Assistant configuration directory](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/#to-find-the-configuration-directory), under `custom_components/`.
