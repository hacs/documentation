- You cannot download HACS as an [add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on), HACS is an [integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#integration), and not an [add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on)
- HACS does not handle [add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on).

[Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on) and HACS has nothing to do with each other, they are completely different.
