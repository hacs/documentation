- HACS is an [integration](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#integration), and not an [add-on](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on)
- HACS does not handle [add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on).

[Add-ons](https://www.home-assistant.io/glossary/#add-on) and HACS has nothing to do with each other, they are completely different.

## The exception

With all rules, there will at sompoint exist exceptions.

For HACS and add-ons that is now the [Get HACS add-on](https://github.com/hacs/addons) that was made for Home Assistatnt Operating System and Supervised to simplify the initial download of HACS itself.
