title: Experimental features
description: "Use experimental features"

HACS does not do beta releases (anymore). Instead, we have experimental features.
These features are not enabled by default, and you have to enable them manually.

Experimental features will (generally) **not** be documented and will be changed or removed without notice (outside of release notes).

## Enabling experimental features

First, to enable experimental features, go to your [integration panel](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/integrations/).

1. Click "CONFIGURE" on the HACS card.
2. Add a checkmark in the "Enable experimental features" checkbox.
3. Click "SUBMIT".
