But there are a number of different reasons why a developer might not want to publish their repository to HACS, for these situations you can in many cases add it to HACS as a custom repository.

!!! warning

    Not all repositories will work in HACS, since HACS still needs the repository to have a known structure.


If you want to try and add a custom repository to HACS do the following:

![overview_menu](/assets/images/screenshots/overview/menu/light.png#only-light)
![overview_menu](/assets/images/screenshots/overview/menu/dark.png#only-dark)

1. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
1. Select "Custom repositories"
1. Add the URL to the repository.
1. Select the correct type.
1. Click the "ADD" button.
