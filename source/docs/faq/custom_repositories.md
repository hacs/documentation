But there are a number of different reasons why a developer might not want to publish their repository to HACS, for these situations you can in many cases add it to HACS as a custom repository.

!!! warning
    Not all repositories will work in HACS, since HACS still needs the repository to have a known structure.


If you want to try and add a custom repository to HACS do the following:

![overview_menu](/assets/images/screenshots/overview/menu/light.png#only-light)
![overview_menu](/assets/images/screenshots/overview/menu/dark.png#only-dark)

1. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
1. Select "Custom repositories"
1. Add the URL to the repository.
1. Select the correct category.
1. Click the "ADD" button.

![custom_repository_add](/assets/images/screenshots/dialog/custom_repository/add/light.png#only-light)
![custom_repository_add](/assets/images/screenshots/dialog/custom_repository/add/dark.png#only-dark)


!!! tip
    The "Custom repositories" option might be hidden while background tasks is running to stop the user to break their instance. Wait a while or/and check HACS status.
