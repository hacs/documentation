But there are a number of different reasons why a developer might not want to publish their repository to HACS, for these situations you can in many cases add it to HACS as a custom repository.

!!! warning
    Not all repositories will work in HACS, since HACS still needs the repository to have a known structure.


If you want to try and add a custom repository to HACS do the following:

![custom_repositories_entry](/assets/images/custom_repositories_entry.png)

1. Go to any of the sections (integrations, frontend, automation).
1. Click on the 3 dots in the top right corner.
1. Select "Custom repositories"
1. Add the URL to the repository.
1. Select the correct category.
1. Click the "ADD" button.

!!! tip
    The "Custom repositories" option might be hidden while background tasks is running to stop the user to break their instance. Wait a while or/and check HACS status.
