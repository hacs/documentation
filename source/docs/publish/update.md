If your repository is already included in HACS as a default repository and you rename or transfer it, the HACS team will automatically update the records.

## Repository renamed or transferred

If you rename or transfer your repository to a different GitHub account or organization, you do **not** need to open a PR to update the records in HACS. The HACS team will automatically update the records to reflect the new repository location.
