If your repository is already included in HACS as a default repository, certain changes are automatically handled by the HACS team and do not require you to open a pull request.

## Repository renamed or transferred

If you rename or transfer your repository to a different GitHub account or organization, you do **not** need to open a PR to update the records in HACS. The HACS team will automatically update the records to reflect the new repository location.

## Repository archived

If your repository has been **archived** on GitHub, you do **not** need to open a PR for removal. The HACS team will automatically update the records and remove archived repositories from the default pool.
