As a developer you can now add your repository to be included in as a default repository in the store.

Only the owner of the repository or a major contributor to it can submit a PR to have it included as a default.

Custom integrations that exist to alpha/beta test core integrations will not be accepted, you can still use it as a [custom repository](/docs/faq/custom_repositories.md)

Custom integrations that override core integrations will not be accepted, you can still use it as a [custom repository](/docs/faq/custom_repositories.md)

## Before submitting

Add both these actions to your own repository and make sure they pass:

- https://github.com/home-assistant/actions#hassfest (only for integrations)
- https://github.com/hacs/action

When all of this is covered, you can add it to repository type files in https://github.com/hacs/default

In your fork of `hacs/default`, create a new branch for your changes from the `master`branch. Do **not** use the`master` branch directly for your changes.

Your PR needs to be editable, so you can not submit it from an organization.

!!! danger "Read this!"
    _NB!: The list is case sensitive._


When a PR for this is merged, it will show up in HACS after the first scheduled scan.

## CI Checks

When submitting a repository for the default repository a suite of CI checks will be run to ensure that the repository follows the requirements.
All checks needs to pass for the repository to be included (unless something else are agreed on).

### Check Brands
