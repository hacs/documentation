*[Integrations]: previously called "custom components"
*[custom integration]: A custom integration is an integration that has been created by someone from the Home Assistant community and was published for others to use at their own risk. Custom integrations are not supported by the Home Assistant project. They are not reviewed or tested by the Home Assistant development team and thus may negatively impact the stability of your Home Assistant instance. An example of a custom integration is the [Spook](https://spook.boo/) integration.
